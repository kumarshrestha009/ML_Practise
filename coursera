I belong to a middle class family. I cannot afford to pay the fees. My college fee is still due.  However, I want to learn new skills to build my career in Python and become a Python Developer.

I have received my undergraduate degree recently. I have the theoretical knowledge but no practical skills. I want to learn new skills which can help me to build up my career as a Python Developer.

I am currently unemployed and I cannot afford to pay my fees.
