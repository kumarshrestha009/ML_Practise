I am a recent undergraduate student from Nepal. Due to my poor economic condition, I might not be able to pay the course fees. Till now, my college fees is still due. I am applying for this scholarship so that I will get an opportunity to learn and develop new skills. Learning this skill will help to pursue my career in Python Data Science. It will also aid me in getting a good job and earn my living.
I guarantee the IBM committee that I will complete the course and make the best use of it. At the same time, if I get an opportunity to teach these skills, I will not hesitate to share my knowledge and experience. Studying in the coaching center is both the time consuming and expensive. So, I prefer self learning where I can clear my confusion and at the same time develop my skills.


During my undergraduate, I heard about Python Programming Languages. I got a basic knowledge about python via Youtube. Now, I further want to develop my skills and talents. I want to put a milestone towards pursuing my career in Data Science. To sharpen my skills, I want to take this course, at the same time, the certificate earned after the completion of the course will help to prove my skills and knowledge regarding Data Science. I can prove my worthiness which will help to get a better job and earn my living. After taking this course, I will go for the specialization course so that I will have all the knowledge and skills required for Data Science. Gaining the proper skills and knowledge, I also want to the teach and assist the students of Nepal in the field of Data Science. I am taking the online course as there are not such courses available in my country.
